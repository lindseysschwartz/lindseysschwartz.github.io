I am a social scientist with a background in sociology, information science, and the restaurant industry. My research addresses labor, governance, and activism in sociotechnical systems. I primarily use qualitative and participatory research methods, and frequently collaborate with computational researchers in mixed-methods projects.

I am currently a PhD student at the University of Washington Information School, where I am advised by Dr. Nic Weber through the Puget Sound Public Interest Technology Clinic.
