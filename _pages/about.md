I'm a predoctoral research associate at at the Puget Sound Public Interest Technology Clinic at the University of Washington Information School. My research addresses labor, public policy, and governance in sociotechnical systems. I primarily use qualitative and participatory research methods, and draw from areas of urban sociology, science and technology studies (STS), and critical data studies.
